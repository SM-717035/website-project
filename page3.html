              <h2>Crypto Capital</h2>
                <p>Cryptocurrency is not inherently superior to any other form of investment. However, the combination of cryptocurrency’s novel technology with its nature as a currency could give it the potential to enhance or replace traditional currency altogether – and there’s nothing more integral to modern human society than currency.</p>
                <p>With such a high ceiling to achieve, cryptocurrency has the potential to promise returns far more extravagant than typical investment options. Whether this is enough for crypto to deserve a seat at your table, is up to you.</p>

            <h2>Volatility in the Virtual Market: How Safe is Crypto?</h2>
              <p>The cryptocurrency market is known to be incredibly volatile at times, and you should be mentally and financially prepared for the unstable nature of its environment should you choose to step foot in it. Factors like knowledge or timing play a significant role in how well your investment decisions may serve you, but dumb luck can always play its part in making or breaking your wallet overnight. The unpredictability of your portfolio can be greatly mitigated or exacerbated depending on which coins you choose to invest in, but there is one general rule for nearly all coins on the market: What Would Bitcoin Do? Any given coin on the market’s health can largely be determined by how well the oldest coin out there is faring, BTC. Bitcoin not doing well? Ethereum, Dogecoin, and almost every other cryptocurrency out there is likely to be in the dumps. Bitcoin on the rise? Expect prices across the whole market to jump. With only a few exceptions, all coins drift in the wake of Bitcoin. This should be to no one’s surprise, however, as Bitcoin holds 50% of the entire crypto market.</p>
              <p>There are ways to play it safer than not, though. Certain mindsets, such as “HODLing”, or buying without the intention of selling long-term, can improve the general level of safety regarding your investments: even if the price of your coin goes down, you only lose if you sell. With Bitcoin in particular, which has a set of anti-inflationary properties and a capped supply, your return of investment is likely to rise greatly – but only after longer periods of time.</p>
              <p>Other, more short-term investment methods offer riskier but quicker ways to turn a profit. “Day trading” is the term used to describe an investor who buys and sells a particular coin on a very short notice once that coin has risen in price – even if by a tiny fraction of a cent. In effect, this investor is able to turn very quick profits in very short amounts of time at a greatly higher risk.</p>
              <p>It is important to take note that innumerable people have lost both their money and livelihoods by investing into the crypto market. It is by no means a guarantee for positive return and should not be treated as a method to blindly and thoughtlessly earn “free money”. In short, while the cryptocurrency market can be extremely volatile and financially dangerous, how safe your well-being regarding your crypto investments is largely down to how and with which coin(s) you choose to invest.</p>

              <h2>Buying Bitcoin, Exchanging Ethereum, Dealing Doge</h2>
                <p>In order to directly buy into the cryptocurrency market, you would have to visit an exchange – a marketplace or bank where people buy and sell crypto assets. You would trade traditional currency for the coin and amount of your choice, and store it on what’s called a “wallet”. This wallet can be digital or physical, but every wallet has a unique address through which coins are deposited and withdrawn.</p>
                <p>There is one other way of entering the world of cryptocurrency, which is to “mine”, or generate these coins yourself. This process of mining coins however requires a significant amount of special and expensive hardware as well as deep background knowledge of cryptocurrency – and thus is not an advised method of obtaining cryptocurrency for anyone except experts. So, if you are looking to own your first cryptocurrency, it is highly recommended to simply visit an exchange to purchase a coin that has already been mined!</p>
