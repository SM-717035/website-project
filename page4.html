                <h2>Just Like Old Times</h2>
                    <p>The technology powering cryptocurrency is still extremely novel. Similar to when the Internet as we know it was first born in the 90s, few knew of it and fewer still could reliably use it. Malicious opportunists had ample room to take advantage of those who did not fully understand it. Much of the general population laughed at it and made light of its future potential in our world.</p>
                    <p>But as time went on, and the revolution of the Internet started to begin, the technology became more and more respected and further infused with our daily lives. Decades later, it has become an inseparable and indispensable element of modern society. It took the Internet 30 years to do this – to go from only the odd enthusiast knowing of its existence to powering the human world as we know it today. Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general, has only been around for 10.</p>
                    <p>Who’s to say history won’t repeat itself?</p>
