            <h2>Cryptocurrency – What is It?</h2>
              <p>Digital gold, satoshis or magic internet money – cryptocurrency has no shortage of creative aliases that you may have heard of. However, despite how many different names folks have given it, cryptocurrency largely remains a mystery to a significant portion of people – internet newbie and savvy alike.</p>
              <p>Cryptocurrency is intangible. You can’t see it, touch it, or smell it – so what is it?</p>
              <p>The most famous example of all cryptocurrencies is Bitcoin, a decentralized and digital form of currency that uses encryption technology, or cryptography, to keep itself secure and its users anonymous. Being “decentralized” means that Bitcoin does not need to rely on centralized entities, such as banks, businesses, or governments, to send and receive payments. This means that Bitcoin is immune to being controlled or manipulated by any one authority, thus making it a freer and safer alternative to more traditional methods of handling finances. Decentralization allows for payments to be made to and from anyone, anywhere – regardless of borders, politics, or regulations.</p>

                <h2>Count Crypto, Not Sheep</h3>
                  <p>It’s likely that you’ve heard of Bitcoin, but you may have heard of others, such as Ethereum, or perhaps Dogecoin. After all, the term cryptocurrency was made plural for a reason! There are thousands and thousands of cryptocurrency projects out and about today, but how different can coins like Ethereum and Dogecoin be? Enough so that some would consider it a cardinal sin to utter both names in the same breath, it turns out.
                  <p>But how did they all come to be?</p>
                  <p>Brought to life in the late 2000s, cryptocurrency took its first steps with the invention of Bitcoin. Defined in a whitepaper written by a mysterious figure known as “Satoshi Nakamoto”, Bitcoin was the first and only cryptocurrency in existence. Still in its infancy, only a niche population of enthusiasts knew of it, and even less actually used it. Many years went by where Bitcoin remained almost entirely unnoticed, deemed laughable as a waste of money by all except a small few who believed in the technology. But as the time went by, Bitcoin’s popularity grew – and people began to laugh less and less. Eventually, its success was proof that there was indeed a market for its service – one that would explode to massive proportions. It wasn’t long before whitepapers for new projects began being written, their roads paved by Bitcoin’s successes. One by one, these projects were launched – and thus, new “coins” were born.</p>

              <h2>Knowing the Differences</h3>
              <p>Now, it is important to understand that while all coins digital in nature, they are most definitely not all the same! Most of these new cryptocurrencies sought to serve a particular purpose within the growing crypto-market, refining the technology Bitcoin debuted with. Some, like Ethereum, did this better than others, growing into a valuable asset highly sought after for its well-engineered utility. But not all coins are so “well-made”, so to speak. Other coins were made entirely as mindless jokes, with some, like Dogecoin, shooting into popularity through the use of nothing but internet trends and celebrity mentions. Years of ever-heightening popularity later, tens of thousands of coins have been created, for one purpose or another – or none at all. Anybody, even you, can make a new coin in less than five minutes. And that is why, above all else, it is most important to know coin that you might be putting your money into!</p>
